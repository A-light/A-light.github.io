1. Initial: `SELECT @Rank := 0, @Sal := null, @Type := null`

2. Merge the table of Department  into the table of Employee and sort employee with salary and department.  `SELECT D.Name Department, E.Name Employee, E.Salary Salary FROM Employee E INNER JOIN Department D ON E.DepartmentId = D.Id ORDER BY E.DepartmentId, E.Salary DESC`

3. Number employees by salary and department. 

   ` IF(@Type = Department, 
            CASE 
            WHEN @Sal = Salary THEN @Rank
            WHEN @Sal := Salary or 1 THEN @Rank := @Rank + 1 
            END, 
            @Rank := 1)`

4.  Obtain the top three salaries of the employees in different departments.
